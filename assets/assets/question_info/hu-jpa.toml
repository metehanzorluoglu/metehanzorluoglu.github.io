* Click on the link provided for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Smart Location database, available here.
* Under "View In," select "ArcGIS Online Map Viewer”
* Click on the magnifying glass in the bottom right corner and enter the address for the project area inside the text box that appears.
* On the left, click on "Basemap" (the icon with four small squares) and select "Imagery Hybrid."
* Click on "Layers" in the top left if it is not already selected.
* Click on the right-pointing arrow next to "Smart Location Database" to reveal the drop-down menu.
* Click on the eye icon next to “Activity density (housing + jobs per acre)” to change the visibility.
  * Zoom in or out on the map to view entire project area
* Click on "Properties” in the top right. Cross-reference color(s) in the project area with the color/number range listed under “Symbology.”
  * For each color-coded Block Group, convert the Activity Density to a numerical value as follow: No activity → 0; 0-0.27 → 1; 0.28-2.02 → 2; 2.03-4.30 → 3; 4.31-8.31 → 4; >8.32 → 5.
  * If the project area straddles multiple color-coded zones, calculate the average of the numerical values. Round decimals of .5 or more up to the next whole number and decimals under .5 down.
  * Then, convert the numerical value back into the corresponding density.
* Select the corresponding Density.'''
